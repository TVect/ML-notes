# Introduction

In this lecture we will directly parametrise the policy $$\pi_{\theta}(s, a) = P [a | s; Î¸]$$, instead of the state-value or action-value.

**Advantages & Disadvantages of Policy-Based RL**

- **Advantages**:

    Better convergence properties

    Effective in high-dimensional or continuous action spaces

    Can learn stochastic policies

- **Disadvantages**:

    Typically converge to a local rather than global optimum

    Evaluating a policy is typically inefficient and high variance

## Policy Search

Goal: given policy $$\pi_{\theta}(s, a)$$ with parameters $$\theta$$, find best $$\theta$$.

But how to measure the quality of a policy $$\pi_{\theta}$$?

- In episodic environments we can use the start value:

    $$ J_1(\theta) = V^{\pi_{\theta}}(s_1) = E_{\pi_{\theta}} [v_1] $$

- In continuing environments we can use the average value:
    
    $$ J_{avV} (\theta) = \sum_{s} d^{\pi_0}(s) V^{\pi_0}(s) $$
    
    Or the average reward per time-step:
    
    $$ J_{avR} (\theta) = \sum_{s} d^{\pi_0}(s) \sum_{a} \pi_{\theta}(s, a) R_s^a $$
    
    where $$d^{\pi_0}(s)$$ is stationary distribution of Markov chain for $$\pi_{\theta}$$


Policy based reinforcement learning is an optimisation problem, and we focus on gradient descent based methods.


# Finite Difference Policy Gradient

Computing Gradients By Finite Differences

# Monte-Carlo Policy Gradient

We now compute the policy gradient analytically.

Assume policy $$\pi_\theta$$ is differentiable whenever it is non-zero, and we know the gradient $$ \triangledown_\theta \pi_\theta(s, a) $$.

**Likelihood ratios** exploit the following identity

$$ \triangledown_\theta \pi_\theta(s, a) = \pi_\theta(s, a) \frac{\triangledown_\theta \pi_\theta(s, a)}{\pi_\theta(s, a)} = \pi_\theta(s, a) \triangledown_\theta \log \pi_\theta(s, a) $$

The **score function** is $$ \triangledown_\theta \log \pi_\theta(s, a) $$.

## Policy Gradient Theorem

**One-Step MDPs**

Consider a simple class of one-step MDPs

- Starting in state $$s \sim d(s)$$.

- Terminating after one time-step with reward $$r = R(s,a)$$.

Use likelihood ratios to compute the policy gradient:

$$J(\theta) = E_{\pi_{\theta}} [r] = \sum_{s \in S} d(s) \sum_{a \in A} \pi_\theta(s, a) R_{s,a}$$

$$\triangledown_\theta J(\theta) = \sum_{s \in S} d(s) \sum_{a \in A} \pi_\theta(s, a) \triangledown_\theta \log \pi_\theta(s, a) R_{s,a} = E_{\pi_{\theta}} [\triangledown_\theta \log \pi_\theta(s, a) r]$$

**Policy Gradient Theorem**

The policy gradient theorem generalises the likelihood ratio approach to multi-step MDPs.

Replaces instantaneous reward $$r$$ with long-term value $$Q_\pi(s, a)$$

Policy gradient theorem applies to start state objective, average reward and average value objective

> Theorem
For any differentiable policy $$\pi_\theta(s,a)$$,
for any of the policy objective functions $$J = J_1$$, $$J_{avR}$$; or $$\frac{1}{1-\gamma} J_{avV}$$,
the policy gradient is
$$\triangledown_\theta J(\theta) = E_{\pi_{\theta}} [\triangledown_\theta \log \pi_\theta(s, a) r]$$
